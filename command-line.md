How would I explain the command line to someone? Hmm
The command line is a way of speaking directly to your computer, giving it instructions to perform certain things and to find your way around all the different fiies.

10 terminal commands

ls - lists all the files in the directory
pwd - shows you which directory you are in
mkdir - creates a new directory
cd - changes the directory you are in
rm - removes a file
mv - renames or moves a file
open - opens up a file
hostname - the name of the computer you a working with
cp - copy a file
